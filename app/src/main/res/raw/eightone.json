    "java": "Here's a Java solution to find the longest palindromic substring using dynamic programming:\n\n```java\npublic String longestPalindrome(String s) {\n    int n = s.length();\n    boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];\n    int start = 0;\n    int maxLength = 1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        dp[i][i] = true;\n    }\n\n    for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < n - length + 1; i++) {\n            int j = i + length - 1;\n            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {\n                if (length == 2 || dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {\n                    dp[i][j] = true;\n                    if (length > maxLength) {\n                        maxLength = length;\n                        start = i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return s.substring(start, start + maxLength);\n}\n```\nThis Java code efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring in the input string 's'.",
    "python": "And here's a Python solution to find the longest palindromic substring using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    start = 0\n    maxLength = 1\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = True\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j]:\n                if length == 2 or dp[i + 1][j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = True\n                    if length > maxLength:\n                        maxLength = length\n                        start = i\n\n    return s[start:start + maxLength]\n```\nThis Python code effectively finds the longest palindromic substring in the input string 's'."
